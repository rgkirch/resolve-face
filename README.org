#+TITLE: Face Resolve
#+AUTHOR: Richie Kirchofer
#+DESCRIPTION: An Emacs Lisp utility to completely resolve a face's visual attributes, including all inheritance.

* Face Resolve

This package provides a single utility function, =resolve-face=, designed to fully resolve any Emacs face specification into a final, flat property list (plist) of its visual attributes.

It correctly handles:
- Named faces (e.g., ='font-lock-warning-face=)
- Anonymous faces (e.g., ='(:weight bold)=)
- Single inheritance (e.g., ='(:inherit error)=)
- Multiple inheritance (e.g., ='(:inherit (face-a face-b))=)

The function traverses the entire inheritance tree and returns a plist containing only the final, effective visual attributes (like =:foreground=, =:background=, =:weight=, etc.), excluding the structural =:inherit= property itself.

** Motivation

While Emacs's face system is powerful, it can be difficult to determine the final appearance of text that has a complex face applied to it. The built-in =face-attribute= function works well for individual attributes but does not provide a single, comprehensive view of a fully resolved face. This utility solves that problem by providing a "what you see is what you get" plist for any given face.

** Installation

Place =resolve-face.el= in your Emacs =load-path= and require it in your configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'resolve-face)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

The package exposes one function: =resolve-face=.

*** Function: =resolve-face= (FACE)

Return a resolved plist of visual attributes for FACE.

FACE can be a named face symbol (e.g., ='font-lock-warning-face=) or an anonymous face plist (e.g., ='(:inherit error :weight bold)=).

Example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim
;; Resolve a named face that inherits from 'warning'
(resolve-face 'font-lock-warning-face)
#+end_src

RESULTS:
: (:foreground "#ECBE7B")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results verbatim
;; Resolve an anonymous face with multiple inheritance
(resolve-face '(:inherit (bold-italic warning) :foreground "blue"))
#+end_src

RESULTS:
: (:foreground "blue" :weight bold :slant italic :foreground "#ECBE7B")
